            <h2>What you need to know about spas!</h2>
            <p>A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give medicinal
                baths. Spa towns or spa resorts (including hot springs resorts) typically offer various health
                treatments, known as balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to
                prehistoric times, and such practices have been popular worldwide, especially in Europe and Japan. Day
                spas are also quite popular and offer various personal care treatments.</p>

            <h3 id="Origins">Origins of the term</h3>
            <p>The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, known since Roman times when the location
                was called Aquae Spadanae. The word "spa" itself denotes "fountain." Some experts suggest the word
                originated from the name of this Belgian town where a curative natural spring was discovered in the 14th
                century.</p>

            <h3 id="Treat">Treatments</h3>
            <p>A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is a non-medical procedure designed to
                improve the health of the body. These are often performed at resorts, destination spas, day spas, beauty
                salons, or schools.</p>

            <h3 id="Trends">Recent trends</h3>
            <p>Modern spa therapies are linked to beauty, pampering, indulgence, and health. The spa industry is growing
                rapidly, with wellness being embraced as its core business. By the late 1930s, more than 2,000 health
                resorts utilizing hot or cold springs were operating in the United States.</p>
